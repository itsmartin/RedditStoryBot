# RedditStoryBot

This is a simple bot which checks for new submissions to a subreddit, and posts
a comment with a list of the submitter's other posts.

It was originally written to be used in [/r/gametales](http://reddit.com/r/gametales).

### How to use

* You will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
[PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.org/).
* Rename `config.sample.py` to `config.py` and change the values as appropriate.
* Run the bot with `python3 RedditStoryBot.py`.
